# Approval Protocol

Define how Specwright records durable human approval for auditable work
artifacts.

## File Location

- Work-level approval ledger: `{workArtifactsRoot}/{workId}/approvals.md`
- Approval state travels with auditable artifacts, not runtime-only session
  state.
- `workflow.json` is never approval truth — this is a hard invariant, not guidance.

## Approval Scopes

- `design` — approves the design artifact set that `/sw-plan` consumes
- `unit-spec` — approves one unit's `spec.md` / `plan.md` / `context.md`
- `accepted-mutant` — approves one accepted-mutant lineage record for the
  live `/sw-verify --accept-mutant` flow

Use one active approval entry per design or unit-spec scope. `unit-spec`
entries also carry `unitId`. `accepted-mutant` uses one active entry per
`mutantId`.

## Approval Status Vocabulary

Only these status values are valid:

- `APPROVED`
- `STALE`
- `SUPERSEDED`

Semantics:

- `APPROVED` — a human approved the current artifact set hash for the scope
- `STALE` — the approved artifact set hash no longer matches current contents
- `SUPERSEDED` — a newer approval replaced an older approval for the same scope

## Approval Source Classification

Only these source classifications are valid:

- `command` — human-triggered lifecycle command such as `/sw-plan` or `/sw-build`
- `review-comment` — human approval captured from a PR review or issue comment
- `external-record` — human approval imported from another durable system
- `headless-check` — automation validated or reported lineage but did not approve

`headless-check` may report `STALE` or missing lineage, but it MUST NOT create
an `APPROVED` entry.

## Accepted-Mutant Lineage

Accepted mutants are not silent config waivers. The config list is only the
lookup surface for the current branch; durable approval truth lives in
`approvals.md`. The canonical config linkage is
`config.gates.tests.mutation.acceptedMutants[]`.

Each `accepted-mutant` entry is an auditable approval record tied to the mutant
lineage and carries:

- `unitId`
- `mutantId`
- `reason`
- `configPath` or equivalent config linkage
- `approvedAt`
- `expiresAt`

Entries missing any of these lineage fields fail closed: helper assessment and
verify treat them as `STALE` rather than implicitly approved.

Default expiry is 90 days from approval. Once `expiresAt` passes, or the
underlying mutant lineage no longer matches the current artifact set, the
approval becomes `STALE` and verify must surface it again.

## Artifact Set Hashing

Approval freshness is determined by a deterministic artifact-set hash:

1. Normalize each artifact path relative to the work or unit directory.
2. Sort the artifact paths lexically.
3. Hash each artifact's contents.
4. Hash the ordered manifest of `{path, content hash}` pairs.

The resulting `artifactSetHash` is the approval fingerprint. If any approved
artifact changes or disappears, the approval becomes `STALE`.

## Compact Freshness Reason Codes

Human-readable closeout and reviewer-facing approval summaries use one compact
reason-code vocabulary when approval lineage is not current:

- `missing-entry` — no approval entry exists for the required scope
- `artifact-set-changed` — the approved artifact set hash no longer matches the
  current artifacts
- `missing-lineage` — an `accepted-mutant` entry is missing required lineage
  fields or carries an invalid `approvedAt`
- `expired` — an `accepted-mutant` entry has an invalid or elapsed `expiresAt`
- `superseded` — the entry was replaced by a newer approval in the same slot

These reason codes keep terminal and packet summaries compact. Full hashes,
artifact manifests, and accepted-mutant lineage remain in the approval ledger
or deeper evidence artifacts instead of the terminal-first digest.
`status-card.json` and shared operator surfaces must reuse this compact reason-code
vocabulary instead of inventing adapter-local approval wording.

## File Shape

`approvals.md` stays human-readable, but the machine-readable source of truth is
the fenced JSON ledger between the approval markers.

## Lifecycle Responsibilities

- `sw-design` identifies the design artifact set awaiting approval. It does not
  write an `APPROVED` entry on its own.
- `sw-plan` records design approval on entry when a human triggered `/sw-plan`.
  In headless mode it must validate an existing human approval instead of
  fabricating one.
- `sw-pivot` reassesses design freshness when work-level artifacts change and
  reassesses `unit-spec` freshness when current or remaining unit artifacts
  change. It preserves the stale lineage with compact freshness reasons instead
  of fabricating a replacement approval entry.
- `sw-build` records or validates `unit-spec` approval on entry using the
  current unit artifact set.
- `sw-verify` validates approval freshness before gate execution and reports
  approval lineage separately from ordinary code-quality findings.
- `sw-verify --accept-mutant {id} --reason "{prose}"` records or refreshes an
  `accepted-mutant` approval entry with config linkage and expiry (default:
  90 days from approval) instead of relying on a silent config-only waiver.

## Shared Helper Contract

Shared approval helpers must provide deterministic support for:

- artifact-set hashing
- parsing and serializing `approvals.md`
- recording a new approval entry while marking older entries for the same scope
  as `SUPERSEDED`
- recording or refreshing `accepted-mutant` entries without collapsing them
  into a silent config-only waiver
- validating approval freshness against current artifacts
- assessing both `design` and `unit-spec` entries against pivoted artifact sets
  without special-case logic that would hide stale lineage
- returning structured freshness assessment with status, compact reason code,
  and approved/current artifact hashes when applicable
- rejecting any attempt to create `APPROVED` approval state from
  `headless-check`
