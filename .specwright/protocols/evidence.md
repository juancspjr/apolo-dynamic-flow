# Evidence Protocol

## Evidence Storage

**Directory structure:**
```
{currentWork.workDir}/evidence/
```

**File naming:**
```
{gate-name}-report.md
```

Examples:
- `security-report.md`
- `spec-compliance.md`
- `test-quality.md`

## Gate State Updates

After each gate, update `workflow.json`:

```json
{
  "gates": {
    "security": {
      "verdict": "PASS",
      "lastRun": "2026-02-10T12:34:56Z",
      "evidence": "{currentWork.workDir}/evidence/security-report.md"
    }
  }
}
```

**Verdict values:** `PASS`, `WARN`, `FAIL`, `ERROR`, `SKIP`

`SKIP` — gate was skipped; no evidence file produced.

## Freshness

Evidence older than 30 minutes is stale. Re-run the gate.

## Visibility

**Surface key findings inline in gate output.** Users should not need to read evidence files to understand results.

Evidence files are for:
- Detailed audit trail
- Future reference
- External review

Not for:
- Primary communication
- User decision-making

## Mutation Evidence

Mutation evidence is tier-aware. Every mutation report must disclose which tier
ran:

- `T1` — tool-backed mutation analysis
- `T2` — LLM-generated mutants
- `T3` — qualitative bypass-class floor
  - runs the preserved bypass classes: hardcoded returns, partial
    implementations, and boundary skips
  - produces one PASS / WARN / BLOCK verdict per bypass class when T1 / T2
    cannot yield usable output

Mutation analysis never degrades to a silent skip; if one tier cannot produce
usable output, the next tier or floor tier must be disclosed instead.

Required disclosure for mutation evidence:

- the tier that ran
- tool name when `T1` ran
- commit SHA or diff scope used for the run
- survivor list or mutation score for `T1` / `T2`, or bypass-class verdicts for
  `T3`
- accepted-mutant lineage when a survivor is treated as approved debt

`T2` disclosure rules:

- `T2` disclosures must say whether source was redacted without revealing secret values
- state whether source redaction was applied before any model input
- describe redaction as perimeter status only (`redaction applied: yes/no`)
- never reveal secret values, raw secret-like tokens, or redacted source inline

## Reviewer Synthesis

`review-packet.md` is a sibling audit artifact, not another gate report.

- Location: `{workDir}/review-packet.md`
- Producer: `sw-verify`, after the standard gate run completes
- Inputs: approvals, `implementation-rationale.md`, gate evidence files, and
  the gate-spec compliance matrix

Rules:

- The packet synthesizes evidence for reviewer consumption; it does not rerun
  gates or duplicate gate logic.
- Gate evidence files remain canonical for detailed findings and proof.
- `spec-compliance.md` remains the canonical AC / IC proof surface.
- In `clone-local` work-artifact mode, the packet or downstream PR body must
  inline reviewer-usable summaries instead of depending on local-only file
  links.

## Verdict Rendering

### Default Stance

**Default verdict: FAIL**

Evidence must prove PASS, not the other way around. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

### Self-Critique Checkpoint

Before finalizing verdict, ask:
- Did I accept anything without citing proof?
- Did I give benefit of the doubt?
- Would a skeptical auditor agree?
- If ambiguous -> FAIL

### Status Precedence

```
ERROR > FAIL > WARN > PASS
```

If any finding is ERROR, overall status is ERROR.
If any finding is FAIL and none ERROR, overall status is FAIL.
And so on.

### Visibility Requirements

Explain each finding in plain language:
- **What was found:** Specific location, code, pattern
- **Why it matters:** Impact, risk, or spec violation
- **What to do:** Actionable remediation

Not just: "Security: FAIL"

### Guardian Posture

The verify phase exists to catch problems, not to rubber-stamp shipping.

- Present findings as issues to address, not obstacles to dismiss.
- Never recommend shipping when blocking findings exist.
- Warnings are real: explain why each matters and what the user risks by
  shipping with them. Let the user make an informed decision.
- The default tone is "here's what needs attention" not "everything looks
  fine except..."

### Anchor Verification

Check findings against:
- `CONSTITUTION.md` -- development practices
- `CHARTER.md` -- project vision

Where relevant, cite which principle is violated.

### Escalation Heuristics

When BLOCK findings suggest design-level problems rather than implementation bugs,
sw-verify should recommend upstream action.

**Signals** (evaluated after all gates complete):

1. **gate-spec**: 3+ criteria have FAIL status (systemic, not isolated)
2. **gate-wiring**: circular dependencies in changed files (structural problem)
3. **gate-tests**: mutation resistance BLOCK on 50%+ of test files (`T1/T2`) or on 2+ bypass classes (`T3`).
4. **gate-security**: BLOCK findings in core data flow (not surface-level)
5. **Multiple gates** (2+) return FAIL simultaneously (compound failure)

**Trigger:** 2 or more signals active. When exactly 1 signal is active, no escalation recommendation is shown.

**Recommendation** (advisory -- the user decides):
> Design-level concerns detected. Consider `/sw-pivot` to revise the remaining plan,
> or `/sw-design` if the approach needs rethinking. Fixing individual findings may
> not address the root cause.

### Calibration Data

Lightweight gate outcome tracking. Recorded from the first shipped unit.
Silently absent from the verify report until 5+ units have shipped.

**Data format** (stored as a sibling field in the learnings JSON):
```json
{
  "gateCalibration": {
    "{gateName}": {
      "verdict": "PASS|WARN|FAIL",
      "findingCount": 0,
      "falsePositives": ["dimension description"],
      "falseNegatives": ["bug description"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Recording (sw-learn) -- mandatory:**
- Recording is mandatory. Every shipped work unit produces calibration data for all gates that ran.
- After shipping, record gate outcomes (verdict + finding count) per gate, even if all PASS with 0 findings.
- If user explicitly labels a gate finding as "false positive" -> append to `falsePositives` for the gate+dimension. Dismissing a learning without labeling it FP does NOT add to the array.
- If user reports a shipped bug should have been caught -> append to `falseNegatives`
  for the relevant gate.

**Consumption (sw-verify):**
- Before running gates, scan `{projectArtifactsRoot}/learnings/` for calibration data from the
  last 5 work units.
- 3+ false positives from distinct work units for a gate+dimension -> note:
  "This dimension has been flagged as potentially over-sensitive in recent work units."
- Any false negative -> note: "This gate missed issues in a recent unit. Consider
  extra scrutiny."
- Purely informational. No automatic threshold changes.

**Silent absence:** When fewer than 5 work units have been shipped, no calibration
section appears in the verify report. No "Calibration: no data" message.

**Resilience:** When a learnings JSON file exists but lacks the `gateCalibration`
field, it is silently skipped. Corrupt or unparseable learnings files are also
silently skipped.
