# Delegation Protocol

## Custom Subagents

Specwright defines agents as markdown files in `agents/`. Each file has YAML frontmatter (name, description, model, tools) and a system prompt body. Claude Code loads these at **session start**. Agents added mid-session require `/agents` or a session restart to become available.

## Invocation

**Primary** (when agents are loaded):
```
Task({
  subagent_type: "{agent-name}",
  description: "Short description",
  prompt: "Full context brief with deliverable, file paths, constraints, output format"
})
```

**Fallback** (mid-session or when custom agents unavailable):
```
Task({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "{model from roster}",
  description: "Short description",
  prompt: "{agent system prompt from agents/{name}.md}\n\n{task-specific brief}"
})
```

When using fallback, read the agent's markdown file and include its system prompt in the task prompt. This preserves the agent's behavioral constraints.

## Context Handoff

Agents do NOT inherit the main conversation. Include in every prompt:
- The specific deliverable expected
- File paths to read (spec, plan, config, constitution)
- Relevant constraints from constitution
- Expected output format

## Context Discipline

Request structured, concise output. Every delegation prompt should end with
an output format constraint (e.g., "Return: files changed, test results,
issues found. No narrative.").

Between tasks in multi-task skills: reference committed source code by path
only (agents can Read it). Spec/plan/design content needed for the current
task should still be included inline — agents have no conversation history.

For large context documents (context.md, design.md): include only sections
relevant to the current task, not the full document.

## Build Grounding

For build-time delegation, pass file paths for grounding docs instead of
describing them inline:
- `{currentWork.workDir}/repo-map.md` when it exists
- `core/skills/lang-building/{language}.md` for the task's language-pattern doc

Build agents read those files directly when the prompt includes the paths.
Language selection is deterministic: use `config.json project.languages[0]`
unless the task is clearly in a different language by file extension.

## Agent Roster

| Agent | Model | Use for | Constraint |
|-------|-------|---------|------------|
| specwright-architect | opus | Design, review, critic | READ-ONLY |
| specwright-tester | opus | Write brutal tests, audit test quality | Adversarial mindset |
| specwright-integration-tester | opus | Write integration/contract/E2E tests at boundaries | No skip conditions. No mocking internal boundaries. |
| specwright-executor | sonnet | Implementation (make tests pass) | No subagents |
| specwright-reviewer | opus | Code quality, spec compliance | READ-ONLY |
| specwright-build-fixer | sonnet | Build/test error fixes | Minimal diffs only |
| specwright-researcher | sonnet | Documentation, API research | READ-ONLY |

## Agent Teams (Experimental)

Agent teams coordinate multiple independent Claude Code sessions (teammates) under a lead session. Unlike subagents, teammates are full sessions with their own context windows, tool access, and the ability to spawn subagents.

**When to use agent teams vs subagents:**

| Factor | Subagents | Agent Teams |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Context | Share caller's context window | Independent context windows |
| Isolation | Same working directory | Can use separate worktrees |
| Nesting | Cannot spawn subagents | CAN spawn subagents (full sessions) |
| Cost | Single context | ~7x tokens in plan mode, linear per teammate |
| Use for | Focused tasks (test writing, implementation, review) | Parallel independent work (research tracks, parallel builds) |

**Use cases:**
- Multiple independent research tracks
- Competing design approaches evaluated in parallel
- Parallel task execution during builds (see `protocols/parallel-build.md`)
- Large codebases investigated from different angles simultaneously

**Requirements:**
- Environment variable `SPECWRIGHT_AGENT_TEAMS=1` must be set
- For build parallelism: `config.experimental.agentTeams.enabled` must be `true`
- See `protocols/parallel-build.md` for the build-specific procedure

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't delegate simple lookups -- use Glob/Grep directly
- Don't delegate work that requires the main conversation's history
- Don't nest subagent delegation -- subagents cannot spawn other subagents
- Teammates are full sessions and CAN spawn subagents, but cannot spawn teams
- Don't delegate without all necessary context in the prompt
