# Spec Review Protocol

Pre-build spec quality review. Catches untestable criteria, vague language, and
missing edge cases before build time is spent on a bad spec.

## When to Invoke

After each spec is drafted in sw-plan — for both single-unit specs and each
per-unit spec in multi-unit work — before presenting to the user for approval.

## How to Invoke

Delegate to `specwright-architect` with:
- The full spec (all acceptance criteria)
- The design.md for grounding context
- This protocol (the seven dimensions and finding levels below)
- Instruction: "Review these acceptance criteria for quality. Return findings
  grouped by dimension. Do not suggest implementation — only assess spec quality."

## Quality Dimensions

### 1. Testability
Each criterion must describe an observable, verifiable outcome. A tester must
be able to write a concrete test (automated or manual check) without guessing.

**Flag phrases:** "works correctly", "handles edge cases", "performs well",
"is user-friendly", "behaves as expected", "functions properly"

**Example (bad):** "The API handles errors correctly."
**Example (good):** "If the API receives a request with a missing required field,
it returns HTTP 400 with a JSON body containing an `errors` array."

### 2. Measurability
Prefer numeric or behavioral thresholds over subjective adjectives. The pass/fail
boundary must be unambiguous.

**Flag phrases:** "fast enough", "reasonable", "appropriate", "good performance",
"acceptable", "sufficient", "minimal overhead"

**Example (bad):** "The search response is fast enough for users."
**Example (good):** "Search results are returned within 500ms for queries up to
100 characters on a dataset of 10,000 records."

### 3. Completeness
At least one error or boundary case per functional area. Happy-path-only specs
miss the behaviors that matter most.

**Look for:** criteria sets that only describe the success case with no
corresponding error case, input validation, or limit behavior.

### 4. Ambiguity
Acceptance criteria must state what will be verified, not what should happen.
Hedge words leave it to the implementer to decide what "enough" means.

**Flag phrases:** "should", "might", "can", "may", "ideally", "where possible",
"at minimum", "generally"

**Example (bad):** "The form should validate required fields."
**Example (good):** "Submitting the form with an empty required field displays
an inline error message below that field and prevents form submission."

### 5. Grounding
Each criterion must be traceable to a design decision, requirement, or
explicitly stated constraint. Criteria that appear from nowhere may reflect
scope creep or misunderstanding.

**Look for:** criteria that introduce behavior not mentioned in the design.md,
context.md, or the user's stated requirements.

### 6. Testability Proof
The architect's review output must include a concrete test description for each
AC — not a restatement of the criterion, but a specific test: inputs, action,
and expected observable result. Each proof must also state the expected test type
in square brackets.

**Example:** "AC-1 can be tested by: [integration test] calling the real HTTP
endpoint via supertest and asserting the response body contains `{status: 'ok'}`."

**Rule:** If the architect cannot write a concrete test description for an AC,
that AC is a BLOCK finding. Inability to describe a concrete test is evidence
the criterion is not testable as written.

### 7. Test Type Appropriateness
Each criterion that involves a system boundary should specify whether it needs
a unit test, integration test, or E2E test. Criteria that cross internal module
boundaries but are silent about integration expectations are likely to get
tested with mocks when they should be tested with real components.

**Flag patterns:**
- "Data persists across requests" → needs [integration test] with real database,
  not a mocked repository
- "API returns 200 with payload X" → needs [integration test] with real HTTP
  server (supertest/httpx), not mocked request/response objects
- "Config loads from environment" → [unit test] is fine, no boundary crossing
- "Third-party webhook fires on event" → [unit test] with mocked external service
  is appropriate — you don't control the third party
- "Cache invalidates when data changes" → needs [integration test] with real
  cache, not mocked cache client

**WARN**: Criterion crosses an internal boundary (database, HTTP, message queue,
cache, filesystem) but does not specify the test approach. The tester will
likely mock it. Higher severity if the boundary is database or HTTP — these
are the most commonly over-mocked boundaries.

## Finding Levels

| Level | Meaning | Action required |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **BLOCK** | Criterion cannot be tested as written | Must be revised or explicitly overridden by user before spec is finalized |
| **WARN** | Vague language or missing boundary case | User may revise or accept as-is |
| **INFO** | Style suggestion or minor improvement | Never blocking; shown for awareness only |

## Resolution Flow

1. Architect returns findings grouped by dimension (BLOCK first, then WARN, INFO).
2. **BLOCKs:** Present each to the user with the finding and a suggested revision.
   User options: (a) revise the criterion, (b) override with stated reason.
3. **WARNs:** Present alongside the spec at the user approval checkpoint.
   User options: (a) revise, (b) accept as-is.
4. **INFOs:** Show as a summary line. No action required.
5. If any criteria were revised: re-delegate to architect for another pass.
   Maximum 2 re-delegate iterations. After 2 passes, treat remaining WARNs as
   accepted and proceed.
6. Overridden BLOCKs are noted with the user's reason. They do not block approval.

## Failure Mode

If architect returns no findings: spec passes review. Note "Spec review: no issues
found." and proceed to user approval checkpoint.
