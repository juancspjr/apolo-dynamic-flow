# Gate: Spec Compliance

## Goal

Prove that the implementation actually does what was asked for. Every
acceptance criterion in the spec must map to implementation evidence
(file:line) and test evidence (test name at file:line). This is the gate
that closes the loop.

## Inputs

- `{workDir}/spec.md` -- acceptance criteria
- `{repoStateRoot}/work/{selectedWork.id}/workflow.json` -- selected work unit
- The codebase (implementation and tests)

## Outputs

- Evidence file at `{workDir}/evidence/spec-compliance.md`
- Compliance matrix: each criterion → implementation ref + test ref + status
- Gate status in the selected work's `workflow.json`
- The compliance matrix remains the canonical AC / IC proof surface that
  downstream `review-packet.md` synthesis summarizes or references

## Constraints

**Criteria extraction (LOW freedom):**
- Parse spec.md for all acceptance criteria (lines matching `- [ ] AC-*`).
- Number them. Every single one must be mapped. No skipping.
- On the final work unit of a multi-WU design: also parse behavioral integration
  criteria (IC-B{n} entries) from `integration-criteria.md` in the design-level
  directory. IC-B entries are added to the compliance matrix alongside ACs. When
  not on the final work unit, when `integration-criteria.md` does not exist, or
  when `integration-criteria.md` has no IC-B entries, gate-spec operates exactly
  as before — no behavioral IC mapping.

**Evidence mapping (HIGH freedom):**
- For each criterion, search the codebase for implementation evidence.
- For each criterion, search test files for test evidence.
- Delegate to `specwright-reviewer` for thorough analysis if needed.
- For behavioral criteria (execution-path claims, not structural checks), trace
  premises from the spec and code, derive claims from those premises, and draw
  conclusions without adding uncited evidence.
- Evidence must be specific: file path and line number, not "somewhere in src/".

**Verdict (LOW freedom):**
- Follow `.specwright/protocols/evidence.md#verdict-rendering`.
- Criterion with both implementation AND test evidence = PASS.
- Criterion with implementation but no test = WARN.
- Criterion with neither = FAIL.
- Overall: if ANY criterion is FAIL, gate is FAIL.
- IC-B entries (when present): IC-B with both implementation and test evidence = PASS.
  IC-B without test evidence = FAIL (gate-spec's standard verdict vocabulary). Note:
  gate-spec FAIL for IC-Bs and deliverable verification BLOCK for IC-Bs are
  complementary — gate-spec reports the finding within its standard framework,
  deliverable verification enforces the action. gate-spec runs first (as part of the
  6 standard gates); deliverable verification runs after all gates.
- Reference discovered behaviors at INFO level per `.specwright/protocols/build-quality.md`. Does not alter PASS/WARN/FAIL verdict.

**Compliance matrix format:**
```
| # | Criterion | Implementation | Test | Status |
|---|-----------|---------------|------|--------|
| AC-1 | Description | file:line | test_name at file:line | PASS |
```

**Matrix stability (LOW freedom):**
Preserve the five-column compliance matrix shape above. `sw-verify` may digest
or quote it in `review-packet.md`, but gate-spec remains the canonical proof
surface for AC / IC conformance.

## Failure Modes

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No spec.md found | Gate ERROR: "No spec found for this work unit" |
| No acceptance criteria in spec | Gate ERROR: "Spec has no acceptance criteria" |
| Implementation exists but tests don't | WARN per criterion, gate WARN overall |
| Can't determine mapping with confidence | FAIL the criterion. Don't guess. |
